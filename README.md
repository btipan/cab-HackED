# Chrome Extension: CAB Translation Extension

This Chrome extension is a learning tool that allows users to translate other language text to English. The functionality includes:

### **Translation Functionality**
- **Highlight text** → Shows a dialog box on highlight to **translate** selected text.
- **Grammar and definitions** → Clickable tabs provide **further breakdown** to language learners.

### **Using the App**
- **Step 1** → **Highlight** the text you want to translate and click Translate to translate the segment.
- **Step 2** → A **pop-up** with the translated text.
- **Step 3** → **Optionally**, access breakdowns of grammar structures and definitions of words via extra tabs on popup.

These features are designed to improve accessibility and ease of use for individuals with **ADHD/ADD** or people with other **learning limitations** who need explanations, definitions, and grammar breakdowns all in one place rather than spread out on Google Translate, LLMs, and physical textbooks.

### **How to Upload the Extension to Chrome**

Open Google Chrome and type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.

Enable Developer Mode (toggle in the top-right corner), then click Load Unpacked.

Select the folder cab_translation_extension file.
